 ## Introduction

The project is titled as **Book Cricket Game** and developed using C language. Book Cricket is an indoor game which can be played by kids with a book.This game is made for two players. The two players will have to decide who is going to guess the toss. After winning the toss, the player has to select whether he has to bat/bowl first. The player who is going to bat first, need to hold the book. He has to randomly open the pages of the book and look for the last digit of that page number which is nothing but the runs obtained in that particular ball. If the last digit is 7/8/9, then it will be considered as a dot ball. The obtained score will be added to the batsman's score everytime. The batsman will be out if the number is 0. Then, the second player has to play with the book in the same process.
